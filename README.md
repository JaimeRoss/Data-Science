## According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient
